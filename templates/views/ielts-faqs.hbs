          <h3><strong>IELTS FAQs in Nigeria</strong></h3>
          <br /><ol> <li><strong>Who owns the IELTS test?  </strong></li> 
  <P>  The IELTS test is jointly owned by The British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and University of Cambridge - ESOL Examinations.</P>
        
          <LI><STRong>What is the IELTS Test Format?  </STRong></LI>
            
          
          <p> All candidates are tested in Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking Modules. There is a choice of Reading and Writing Modules, where a candidate can either opt for Academic or General Training Module.
          </p>
          <p>The first three Modules- Listening, Reading and Writing- must be completed in one day. The Speaking Module may be taken, at the discretion of the test centre, either before seven days or after the other three modules.
          </p>
            
          
          
            <li><strong>Which IELTS Module should I sit for, Academic or General Training? </strong></li>
          
      <P> The Academic Reading and Writing Modules assess whether a candidate is ready to study or train in the medium of English at an undergraduate or postgraduate level. Admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses is based on the result of these Modules.
          
            
          <br><br>
          The General Training Reading and Writing Modules are not designed to test the full range of formal language skills required for academic purposed, but emphasize basic survival skills in a broad social and educational context. General Training is suitable for candidates who are going to English speaking countries to complete their secondary education, to undertake work experience or training programmes not at degree level, or for immigration purpose to Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</P>
          
          
            <li><strong>Can I retest only for the module where I did not score well instead of repeating the whole IELTS test?  </strong></li>
    <p> No, the candidate needs to re-take the whole test.</p>
          
          
            
          <li><strong>How Long Does the IELTS Result Valid?</strong></li><p>
          There are a number of variables affecting the length of time over which an IELTS score remains valid. As a general rule, it is recommended that a Test Report Form (TRF), that is more than two years old should only be accepted as evidence of present level of ability if accompanied by proof that a candidate has actively maintained or tried to improve their English language proficiency.</p>
