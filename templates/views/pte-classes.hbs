              <p><a href="https://www.pearsonpte.com">PTE</a>  was created by Pearson Language Tests part of the Pearson PLC group, a London-based educational services company with prior experience in institutional English language proficiency testing.
<br><br>
                PTE Academic is endorsed by the Graduate Management Admission Council, who are owners of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and is delivered by Pearson Language Tests - who also deliver PTE General (formerly London Tests of English) and PTE Young Learners (formerly London Tests of English for Children).
                <br><br>
                It is a computer-based exam which focuses on real-life English used in academic surroundings. This is to say that integrated language is used throughout the test and students will listen to a variety of accents and academic language which they will encounter at English-speaking higher education institutions. <br><br>
                The exam will include an unmarked voice recording of the candidate, which should assist institutions in the overall evaluation of the candidate's English language ability and should aid them with their admission decisions. The test will be a maximum of 3 hours long and takers can expect their results to be delivered to them, online, within 5 working days.
