                  There are two versions of the IELTS: the <strong>Academic Version</strong> and the <strong>General Training Version</strong> <br><br>

                  The Academic Version is intended for those who want to enroll in universities and other institutions of higher education and for professionals such as medical doctors and nurses who want to study or practice in an English-speaking country. <br><br>
                  The General Training Version is intended for those planning to undertake non-academic training or to gain work experience, or for immigration purposes.
                  It is generally acknowledged that the reading and writing tests for the Academic Version are more difficult than those for the General Training Version, due to the differences in the level of intellectual and academic rigour between the two versions.
                  <br><br>

                  IELTS is accepted by most Australian, British, Canadian, Irish, New Zealand and South African academic institutions, over 3,000 academic institutions in the United States, and various professional organisations. It is also a requirement for immigration to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
                  No minimum score is required to pass the test. <br><br> An IELTS result or Test Report Form is issued to all candidates with a score from 1 (no knowledge) to 9 (expert user) and each institution sets a different threshold. Institutions are advised not to consider valid a report older than two years, unless the user proves that he has worked to maintain his level

                  <br><br>
                  The IELTS tests all four language skills that are important for effective communication: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The structure of the IELTS is as follows:
                  <ol><li><strong>Reading (60 minutes) (Scoring scale: 0-9 bands)</strong></li>


                  Reading has 3 passages and 40 items (questions). Each item is worth one mark.

                  
                  <li><strong>Writing (60 minutes) (Scoring scale: 0-9 bands)</strong></li>


                  It consists of 2 tasks (Writing Task 1 and Writing Task 2) and candidates must answer BOTH tasks.

                  
                  <li><strong>Listening (40 minutes) (Scoring scale: 0-9 bands)</strong></li>


                  IELTS Listening has four sections, each with 10 items (or questions). Each item is worth one mark.

                  
                  <li><strong>Speaking (11-14 minutes) (Scoring scale: 0-9 bands)</strong></li>
                  </ol>

                  IELTS Speaking is a one-to-one interaction between the candidate and an examiner
