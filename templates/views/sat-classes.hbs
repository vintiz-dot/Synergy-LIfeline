               The <a href="https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat">SAT</a> exam intends to primarily aid Undergrad Schools to assess the potential of the applicants for advanced study. Universities in the US, while inviting applications from prospective students, ask for SAT I scores. <br><br>

               The examination is entirely a paper-based Test. The test is scored on a maximum of 2400. The SAT I score alone cannot guarantee admission into a school - the test is only one of the major factors taken into consideration in the long process of an applicant getting admitted into an undergraduate school he/she desires.
               <br><br>
               SAT I has three sections – Critical Reading, Maths and Writing. The following is the SAT I test structure.

               <strong> What is the scoring scale for the SAT I?</strong>
              
               <hr class="myHr">
               The Mathematics section is scored on a scale from 200-800
               The Critical Reading section is scored on a scale from 200-800
               The Writing section score is split up into two parts. These two scores are combined to calculate a section score ranging from 200-800.
               The entire SAT I score ranges from 400-1600
               <br> <br>
                
               <strong> SAT Subject Test or SAT II</strong>
              
               <br>
               Subject Tests (formerly SAT II: Subject Tests) are designed to measure a student’s knowledge and skills in particular subject areas, as well as his ability to apply that knowledge. Students who want to apply to the Top 15-20 universities in the US are required to take SAT Subject Test.
               <br><br>
               The examination is entirely a paper-based Test. The test is scored on a maximum of 800. SAT®II Subject tests are one-hour tests offered in the following subjects: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Maths Level 1, Maths Level 2, English Literature, US History, World History and Languages.
               <br><br>
               The US-based College Board develops and administers both the SAT I and SAT II. College Board is responsible for setting questions, conducting the test and sending score reports to each examinee.
