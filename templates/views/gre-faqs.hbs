          <h3><strong>GRE FAQs in Nigeria</strong></h3>
          <br /><ol><li><strong>Who conducts GRE in Nigeria</strong></li><p>
            
            GRE is conducted in Nigeria by            ETS (Educational Testing Services) authorized owner of the GRE.</p>
            <li><strong>How is the General Test administered? </strong></li><p>
            
            The General Test is given year-round as a computer-based test in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries. In Nigeria, the test holds between two to four times every month in Abuja, Lagos or Port Harcourt. Paper-based General Test administrations are offered in areas of the world where computer-based testing is not available.</p>
            <li><strong>How Long does it Take to Get my GRE Result?</strong></li><p>
            
            If you take the computer-based General Test, you can view your unofficial Verbal and Quantitative scores at the test center; however, because of the essay scoring process, you will not be able to view your Analytical Writing scores at that time. Verbal, Quantitative and Analytical Writing scores on the computer-based General Test will be sent to you and the institutions you designate to receive your score, within 10 to 15 days of your test administration.</p>
            
            
            <li><strong>Does GRE results Expire?</strong></li><p>
            
            Yes, your SAT results are no more valid after five years from the date they were issued
            6. What is the need to take GRE subject test? 
            Although GRE subject tests are not mandatory, they test your knowledge in the subjects of your choice and thereby aid in making your profile more competitive. One must however check with their desired Universities about the GRE subject test requirement.</p>
