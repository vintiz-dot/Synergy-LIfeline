               A <a href="https://toefl.ereg.ets.org/">TOEFL</a> score is valid for two years and then will no longer be officially reported since a candidate's language proficiency could have significantly changed since the date of the test. Colleges and universities usually consider only the most recent TOEFL score.
                The TOEFL test is a registered trademark of Educational Testing Service (ETS) and is administered worldwide. <br><br>
                
                 
                
              <strong>Internet-based Test</strong>  
                Since its introduction in late 2005, the Internet-based Test (iBT) has progressively replaced both the computer-based tests (CBT) and paper-based tests (PBT), although paper-based testing is still used in selected areas. <br><br>
                The four-hour test consists of four sections, each measuring one of the basic language skills (while some tasks require integrating multiple skills) and all tasks focus on language used in an academic, higher-education environment. Note-taking is allowed during the iBT.
                <br>
                The TOEFL®Internet-based Test (TOEFL®iBT) tests all four language skills that are important for effective communication: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The structure of the TOEFL®iBT is as follows:
                <br>
                 
               <ol> 
               <li><strong>Reading (60-100 min) (36-70 questions) (0-30 scoring scale)</strong> </li>
                
                3-5 passages from academic texts; approx 700 word long with 12-14 questions per passage.
                
                 
                
               <li><strong> Listening (60-90 min) (34-51 questions) (0-30 scoring scale)</strong></li>  
                
                4-6 lectures each 3-5 min long; 6 questions each.
                
                2-3 conversations, each 3 minutes long; 5 questions each.
                
                 
                
              <li><strong>Speaking (20 min) (6 tasks) (0-4 points converted to 0-30 scoring scale)</strong></li>  
                
                2 tasks to express an opinion on a topic; 4 tasks to speak based on what is read and listened to.
                
                 
                <li><strong>Writing (50 min) (2 tasks) (0-5 points converted to 0-30 scoring scale)
            </strong></li>
                
                1 task to write based on what is read or listened to; 1 task to support an opinion on a topic.
                
                The US-based "Educational Testing Service"(ETS), develops and administers the TOEFL®. ETS is responsible for setting questions, conducting the test and sending score reports to each examinee.

               ( Internet-based Test) <br>
                
                The iBT version of the TOEFL test is scored on a scale of 0 to 120 points.
                
                Each of the four sections (Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing) receives a scaled score from 0 to 30. The scaled scores from the four sections are added together to determine the total score.

                <br><br>
                Most colleges use TOEFL scores as only one factor in their admission process. Each college or program within a college often has a minimum TOEFL score required. It is recommended that students check with their prospective institutions directly to understand TOEFL admissions requirements.
